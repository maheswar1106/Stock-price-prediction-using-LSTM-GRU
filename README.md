ðŸš¨Academic Integrity DisclaimerðŸš¨
This project in this repository should only be cited in relation to it as inspiration for initiatives to come. It is not intended to help students complete the requirements of their academic projects. The authors disclaim all liability if a student utilizes this project for any of these reasons. If a student transgresses academic integrity, they alone will bear responsibility. We make it clear that using this repository to fulfill coursework requirements is not advised. As a result, concerns about academic integrity should be discussed with the student rather than the authors.

This project was finished for a University at Buffalo course. This report is not meant to be used by any student to fulfill academic requirements; rather, it is meant to exhibit our work for the purpose of knowledge sharing.

An extensive summary of the models, their importance, the data used, performance metrics, and the main conclusions from the tests carried out are given in this repository file.
